# rock-paper-scissor
A basic rock paper scissor game. Practicing basic javascript.

After finishing:
Didn't really plan out code before hand which I think made the code way longer and messier than it has to be. I sort of patched problems here and there, 
created variables randomly when needed, etc. But not bad for first javascript project.
